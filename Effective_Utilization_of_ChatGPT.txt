Effective Utilization of ChatGPT

1. Formulating Questions and Commands
--------------------------------------
Properly structuring your queries helps you get accurate and meaningful answers.

Best Practices:
- Be Specific: Instead of "Tell me about AI", ask "Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning with examples."
- Add Context: Provide your audience or purpose (e.g., "Summarize this article for a 10th-grade student.")
- Break Complex Tasks: If you need code, explanation, and enhancement, ask in parts.
- Use Role-Play Prompts: e.g., "Act as a Python interviewer and ask me questions."
- Set Format Expectations: e.g., "List 5 advantages and disadvantages in bullet points."

Prompt Templates:
- “Explain like I’m 5…”
- “Compare X and Y in a table”
- “Summarize this in 3 bullet points”
- “Write a Python function that…”


2. Contextual Conversations
----------------------------
ChatGPT remembers recent exchanges within a session. Here’s how to maintain flow and clarity:

Strategies:
- Refer back explicitly: “In the example above…”
- Restate context: “I’m working on a resume for a BPO role…”
- Use numbers or headings in multi-step tasks for clarity.
- Mention goal changes to reset the conversation effectively.

Limitations:
- Long conversations may lose track of context.
- ChatGPT doesn’t remember past chats unless memory is enabled.


3. Ethical Considerations
--------------------------
Responsible and ethical use is key when using AI tools.

Key Points:
- Academic Integrity: Don’t submit AI-generated content as your own work.
- Data Privacy: Never share confidential or personal data.
- Bias Awareness: Always verify outputs for fairness and neutrality.
- Critical Use: Don’t rely on AI for final decisions in legal, health, or financial matters.
- Transparency: Disclose AI usage in professional or public outputs when relevant.

Tip: Use ChatGPT as a tool for **thinking, creating, and learning**, not as a shortcut for decision-making or original authorship.


Summary Tips
-------------
- Clear prompts yield clear results.
- Guide the tone (e.g., casual, formal, bulleted).
- Refine iteratively (“Make this more concise”, “Simplify for kids”).
- Explore tools: file uploads, code interpreter, voice, custom GPTs.
